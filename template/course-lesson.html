                        <td>In this first week, we'll start by cutting through the hype and giving you a realistic view
                            of what AI really is. Let's get started. You have probably seen news articles about how much
                            value AI is creating. According to a study by McKinsey Global Institute, AI is estimated to
                            create an additional 13 trillion US dollars of value annually by the year 2030. Even though
                            AI is already creating tremendous amounts of value into software industry, a lot of the
                            value to be created in a future lies outside the software industry. In sectors such as
                            retail, travel, transportation, automotive, materials, manufacturing, and so on. I should
                            have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don't think AI will have a huge impact on in
                            the next several years. My friends and I used to challenge each other to name an industry
                            where we don't think AI will have a huge impact. My best example was the hairdressing
                            industry because we know how to use AI robotics to automate hairdressing.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>9:40</td>
                        <td>But, I once said this on stage and one of my friends who is a robotics professor was in the
                            audience that day, and she actually stood up and she looked at me in the eye and she said,
                            "You know Andrew, most people's hairstyles, I couldn't get a robot to cut their hair that
                            way." But she looked at me and said, "Your hairstyle Andrew, that a robot can do." There is
                            a lot of excitement but also a lot of unnecessary hype about AI. One of the reasons for this
                            is because AI is actually two separate ideas. Almost all the progress we are seeing in the
                            AI today is artificial narrow intelligence. These are AIs that do one thing such as a smart
                            speaker or a self-driving car or AI to do web search or AI applications in farming or in a
                            factory. These types of AI are one-trick ponies but when you find the appropriate trick,
                            this can be incredibly valuable. Unfortunately, AI also refers to a second concept of AGI or
                            artificial general intelligence. That is the goal to build AI.</td>

                        <td>10:50</td>
                        <td>They can do anything a human can do or maybe even be superintelligence and do even more
                            things than any human can. I'm seeing tons of progress in ANI, artificial narrow
                            intelligence and almost no progress to what AGI or artificial general intelligence. Both of
                            these are worthy goals and unfortunately the rapid progress in ANI which is incredibly
                            valuable, that has caused people to conclude that there's a lot of progress in AI, which is
                            true. But that has caused people to falsely think that there might be a lot of progress in
                            AGI as well which is leading to some irrational fears about evil clever robots coming over
                            to take over humanity anytime now. I think AGI is an exciting goal for researchers to work
                            on, but it'll take most for technological breakthroughs before we get there and it may be
                            decades or hundreds of years or even thousands of years away. Given how far away AGI is, I
                            think there is no need to unduly worry about it. In this week, you will learn what ANI can
                            do and how to apply them to your problems. </td>

                        <td>Later in this, course you'll also see some case studies of how ANI, these one-trick ponies
                            can be used to build really valuable applications such as smart speakers and self-driving
                            cars. In this week, you will learn what is AI. You may have heard of machine learning and
                            the next video will teach you what is machine learning. You also learn what is data and what
                            types of data are valuable but also what types of the data are not valuable. You learn what
                            it is that makes a company an AI company or an AI-first company so that perhaps you can
                            start thinking if there are ways to improve your company or other organizations ability to
                            use AI and importantly, you also learned this week what machine-learning can and cannot do.
                            In our society, newspapers as well as research papers tend to talk only about the success
                            stories of machine-learning and AI and we hardly ever see any failure stories because they
                            just aren't as interesting to report on. But for you to have a realistic view of what AI and
                            what machine-learning can or cannot do, I think is important that you see examples of both
                            so that you can make more accurate judgements about what you may and maybe should not try to
                            use these technologies for.</td>

                            that you will better understand what they can do particularly for a set of narrow ANI tasks.
                            So, that's what you learn this week and by the end of this week, you have a sense of AI
                            technologies and what they can and cannot do. In the second week, you'll learn how these AI
                            technologies can be used to build valuable projects. You learn what it feels like to build
                            an AI project as well as what you should do to make sure you select projects that are
                            technically feasible as well as valuable to you or your business or other organization.
                            After learning what it takes to build AI projects, in the third week, you'll learn how to
                            build AI in your company. In particular, if you want to take a few steps toward making your
                            company good at AI, you see the AI transformation playbook and learn how to build AI teams
                            and also built complex AI products. Finally, AI is having a huge impact on society. In a
                            fourth and final week, you'll learn about how AI systems can be bias and how to diminish or
                            eliminate such biases. You also learn how AI is affecting developing economies and how AI is
                            affecting jobs and be better able to navigate this rise of AI for yourself and for your
                            organization. By the end of this four-week course, you'll be more knowledgeable and better
                            qualified than even the CEOs of most large companies in terms of your understanding of AI
                            technology as well as your ability to help yourself or your company or other organization
                            navigate the rise of AI as I hope that after this course, you'll be in a position to provide
                            leadership to others as well as they navigate these issues. Now, one of the major
                            technologies driving the recent rise of AI is Machine-Learning. But what is Machine
                            Learning? Let's take a look in the next video. </td>
